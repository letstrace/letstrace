Help us stop COVID-19.

We’re building the next generation of secure location logging to preserve privacy and #flattenthecurve

Location logs provide time-stamped records of where users have been, allowing them to share information with health officials accurately and quickly. This helps support contact tracing efforts to slow the spread of the virus.

What’s truly special about Private Kit, though, is its privacy protection. Data never leaves users’ devices without their password entry and explicit consent. The location log generated by Private Kit cannot be accessed from outside the user’s device, meaning data transfer occurs only if the user chooses to share it with the researcher.

Private Kit is a ‘privacy-first’ app that allows you to log your GPS trails on your own phone. The information is stored locally and never shared with anyone (not even with us or MIT) until you explicitly decide to manually export the data. The location log generated by Private Kit cannot be accessed from outside the user’s device. Location information can be imported and exported by the user and used in other projects and applications.

Private Kit’s trail generator logs your device’s location once every five minutes and stores 28 days of data in under 100KB of space – less space than a single picture.  But what is truly exciting about Private Kit is its privacy protection.

## Architecture

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app, supporting both iOS and Android.

The diagram in [docs/Private-Kit-Diagram.png](docs/Private-Kit-Diagram.png) has an overview of the events and services.

## Development environment

First, install Node dependencies:

    npm install

### iOS

To set up your environment, go to the [React Native development environment docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), select "React Native CLI Quickstart", select "iOS" under target OS, then follow the instructions under "Installing dependencies".

Next, run:

    cd ios/
    pod install
    cd ..

To run the app:
    
    npx react-native run-ios

### Android

To set up your environment, go to the [React Native development environment docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), select "React Native CLI Quickstart", select "Android" under target OS, then follow the instructions under "Installing dependencies".

You'll also need to follow the instructions under "Using a virtual device" if you want to use the simulator to run the app.

To run the app:

    npx react-native run-android

### Google Maps API Key

You will need to generate a Google API key in order for the mapping features to work correctly. Refer to this guide [guide](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/get-api-key) in order to create the API key.

Once created you will need to add it to two different places in the project. One for Android and one for iOS.

* Android - open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`and search for `com.google.android.geo.API_KEY`. Add your key to the `android:value` property.
* iOS - open `ios/PrivateKit/AppDelegate.m` and search for `GMSServices provideAPIKey` and replace line with `[GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY"];`

### Troubleshooting

- If you have any trouble with packages not found, try `react-native link` from project directory.
- If you see the error `Failed to load bundle - Could not connect to development server`, kill all other react-native processes and try it again.
